# Advent of Code 2024

This project contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges.

## About

Advent of Code is an annual event in December where participants solve daily programming puzzles. It's a great way to improve your coding skills and have fun with the programming community.

## Structure

Each day's challenge will be organized in its own directory:

```
/day01
/day02
...
```

Each directory will contain:
- my solution for the puzzle
- puzzle description
- input for the puzzle generated on a per-user basis
